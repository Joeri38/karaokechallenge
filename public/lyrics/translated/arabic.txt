I was always scared of myself,
Scared of all my differences,
I called and called but you never got the message.
I’m alone, talking to my imagination.

My love is illegal
My love is illegal
My love drove me insane

You can take away all my stuff
Threaten me, tie my hands up,
Take away my name and deprive me of my rights,
Scorn me.. still, you can’t change me.

You’ve always messed around with my thoughts,
Your voice took home in my head,
Today i’m leaving.
If you forget me that’s fine,
My voice will live on in the songs.

My love is illegal
My love is illegal
My love drove me insane

You can take away all my stuff
Threaten me, tie my hands up,
Take away my name and deprive me of my rights,
Scorn me.. still, you can’t change me.

You can take away all my stuff
Threaten me, tie my hands up,
Take away my name and deprive me of my rights,
Scorn me.. still, you can’t change me.

They cut my wings off and I couldn’t,
I couldn’t leave the cage
I’m a bird that got locked up.

My love is illegal
My love is illegal
My love drove me insane

You can take away all my stuff
Threaten me, tie my hands up,
Take away my name and deprive me of my rights,
Scorn me.. still, you can’t change me.

You can take away all my stuff
Threaten me, tie my hands up,
Take away my name and deprive me of my rights,
Scorn me.. still, you can’t change me.

I tried changing myself but i couldn’t,
I couldn’t stay inside the cage,
I’m a bird you can’t lock up.
