Wait there, I need to talk about so much things
So come here to understand eachother or whatever
Your look was unchained from mine
My heart is so far away from yours

I want to see you again
To talk about you today
That indecision tightened in the heart
That predicament if it is yes or no

Just thinking of losing you one day
I made this song so you won´t forget me
Look at me, let me look at you
Get closer so I can tell you today

You hug me and your body is with mine
Your chest never forgot me

There may exist thousands of them in life
But none will be like you
Because it was true love for me
That made me live to the fullest
I'd change the stars for one of your kisses
I'd change the moon for one look of you
I'd stop living in my paradise
You are my truth, my home
(x2)
Lá, laiá, laiá
